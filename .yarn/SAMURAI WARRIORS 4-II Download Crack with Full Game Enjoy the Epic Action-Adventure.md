Character-switching allows players to take two characters into battles simultaneously, and freely switch between them. This adds more strategic options and variety to the combat, as different characters have different strengths and weaknesses. Hyper attacks are a secondary moveset that allows players to clear out crowds of enemies with a dashing animation, but are ineffective against enemy officers. Rage mode renders the player invincible for a period of time, and also enhances their attacks and musou attack by using the spirit gauge. Duels are special encounters that occur when player-controlled characters meet with enemy officers under specific conditions. Duels are more challenging and intense than regular battles, as they require quick reflexes and timing to win.
 
Samurai Warriors 4-II features a roster of 55 playable characters, including Naomasa Ii, who appears for the first time in the series. The game also includes a create-a-warrior mode, where players can customize their own character with various options and weapons. The game supports single-player and multiplayer modes, as well as remote play together on Steam.
 
Samurai Warriors 4-II is a game that offers a new perspective on the Sengoku era, and a fresh experience for fans of the Samurai Warriors series. The game is available for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, and Nintendo Switch.
  
## Samurai Warriors 4-II Review: A New Perspective on the Sengoku Era
 
Samurai Warriors 4-II is not a sequel, nor an expansion, nor a re-release of Samurai Warriors 4. It is a different version of the same game, with a different focus and content. While Samurai Warriors 4 presented the historical events of the Sengoku era from various regional perspectives, Samurai Warriors 4-II narrows down the scope and tells the personal stories of 13 characters, each with their own motivations, relationships, and challenges. The game also adds Naomasa Ii as a new playable character, who is a loyal retainer of Tokugawa Ieyasu and a master of firearms.

The story mode of Samurai Warriors 4-II consists of 13 chapters, each dedicated to one character. The chapters are divided into several stages, which are mostly taken from Samurai Warriors 4, but with some changes in objectives, enemies, allies, and cutscenes. The stages also have different difficulty levels and optional objectives that can affect the outcome of the story. The story mode is designed to be replayed multiple times, as each character has different interactions and endings depending on their choices and performance.
 
The gameplay of Samurai Warriors 4-II is largely unchanged from Samurai Warriors 4, which means it is still fast-paced, fluid, and satisfying. The game features a character-switching system that allows players to take two characters into battle and switch between them at any time. This adds more variety and strategy to the combat, as different characters have different abilities and weapons. The game also features hyper attacks, which are powerful moves that can clear out crowds of enemies, but are ineffective against enemy officers; rage mode, which makes the player invincible and boosts their attacks for a limited time; and duels, which are one-on-one battles that require quick reflexes and timing.
 
The game also features a survival mode, which is a series favorite that returns from previous games. Survival mode is a challenge mode where players have to survive as long as possible in an endless castle filled with enemies and traps. The mode has various objectives and rewards that change every time the player enters the castle. Survival mode also has online leaderboards and co-op support.
 
Samurai Warriors 4-II is a game that offers a new perspective on the Sengoku era, and a fresh experience for fans of the Samurai Warriors series. The game has a lot of content and replay value, as well as improved graphics and performance on the PlayStation 4 and PC versions. However, the game also has some drawbacks, such as recycled maps and music from Samurai Warriors 4, lack of English voice acting, and some minor bugs and glitches. Samurai Warriors 4-II is not a game for everyone, but for those who enjoy hack and slash games and Japanese history, it is a game worth checking out.
