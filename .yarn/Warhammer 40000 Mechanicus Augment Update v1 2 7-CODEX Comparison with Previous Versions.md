Warhammer 40000 Mechanicus is a game that will appeal to fans of strategy, sci-fi, and Warhammer lore. It offers a challenging and immersive experience that will test your tactical skills and your faith in the Omnissiah.
  
Warhammer 40000 Mechanicus is based on the popular tabletop game Warhammer 40000, created by Games Workshop. It is set in a grimdark future where humanity is beset by enemies from within and without. The Adeptus Mechanicus are a faction of the Imperium of Man, devoted to the worship of technology and the preservation of ancient knowledge. They are also known for their extensive use of cybernetic enhancements, or augments, to improve their physical and mental abilities.
 
The game features a rich and diverse campaign mode, where you can explore the secrets of Silva Tenebris and face the threat of the Necrons, an ancient race of robotic beings that have lain dormant for millennia. You can choose from multiple disciplines for your Tech-Priests, each with their own skills and augments. You can also customize your cohort of troops, from Skitarii Rangers and Vanguard to Kataphron Destroyers and Breachers. You will have to balance your cognition points, a resource that allows you to perform actions and use abilities, and your faith points, a resource that allows you to invoke the blessings of the Omnissiah.
