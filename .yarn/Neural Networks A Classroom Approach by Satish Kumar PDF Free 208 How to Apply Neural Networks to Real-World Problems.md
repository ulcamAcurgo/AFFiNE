The book consists of 16 chapters, divided into four parts. The first part introduces the basic concepts and models of artificial neurons, neural networks, and architectures. The second part deals with supervised learning algorithms, such as backpropagation, radial basis function networks, and support vector machines. The third part explores unsupervised learning algorithms, such as self-organizing maps, competitive learning, and adaptive resonance theory. The fourth part discusses advanced topics, such as recurrent neural networks, fuzzy neural networks, genetic algorithms, and neural network applications.
 
The book is written in a clear and concise style, with numerous examples, exercises, and illustrations. The book also provides MATLAB codes for implementing various neural network algorithms. The book aims to provide a comprehensive and practical guide for students and teachers of neural networks.

One of the main features of the book is that it provides a historical perspective on the development of neural networks, tracing their origins from the early models of McCulloch and Pitts, Hebb, Rosenblatt, and Minsky and Papert, to the modern models of Hopfield, Rumelhart and Hinton, Kohonen, Grossberg, and others. The book also compares and contrasts neural networks with other computational paradigms, such as symbolic AI, fuzzy logic, and evolutionary computing.
