Firmware is the software that controls the hardware and functions of the phone. Updating the firmware can improve the phone's stability, security, and compatibility with new applications. However, updating the firmware also involves some risks, such as losing your data, voiding your warranty, or bricking your phone. Therefore, you should always backup your data before updating the firmware and follow the instructions carefully.
