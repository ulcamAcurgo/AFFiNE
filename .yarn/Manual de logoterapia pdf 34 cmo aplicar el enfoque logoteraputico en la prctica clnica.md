## What is Logotherapy?
 
Logotherapy is based on the premise that humans have a will to meaning, a natural desire to find a reason for their existence and to fulfill their potential. Frankl argued that meaning can be found in three ways: by creating a work or doing a deed, by experiencing something or encountering someone, and by taking a positive attitude toward unavoidable suffering. He also introduced the concept of the existential vacuum, a state of emptiness and boredom that results from the lack of meaning in one's life. According to Frankl, the existential vacuum can lead to various forms of neurosis, addiction, aggression, and depression.
 
Logotherapy aims to help people overcome the existential vacuum and find meaning in their lives. It does not provide ready-made answers or impose values, but rather helps people discover their own unique meaning through dialogue, reflection, and exercises. Logotherapy also teaches people how to cope with suffering and adversity by finding a higher purpose or a deeper sense of responsibility. Frankl believed that suffering can be transformed into an opportunity for growth and spiritual development if it is accepted with dignity and courage.
