However, MATLAB 6.1 is no longer available for download from the official website of MathWorks[^1^], the developer of MATLAB. MathWorks does not have copies of MATLAB 6.1 available (at least officially)[^2^]. Moreover, MATLAB 6.1 is not compatible with Windows 7 or later versions of Windows. It would have to be run in XP emulation mode on Windows 7[^2^].
 
Therefore, if you want to download MATLAB 6.1 free full version, you will have to look for alternative sources. However, be careful of the risks involved in downloading software from unofficial or untrusted websites. You may encounter malware, viruses, or other harmful programs that can damage your computer or compromise your security. You may also violate the terms and conditions of MathWorks by using an unauthorized copy of MATLAB.
 
A better option would be to try the latest version of MATLAB for free. MathWorks offers a free trial of MATLAB and Simulink for 30 days[^1^]. You can also purchase MATLAB and Simulink Student Suite for a discounted price[^3^]. The Student Suite includes MATLAB, Simulink, and 10 of the most widely used add-on products, as well as built-in support for prototyping, testing, and running models on low-cost target hardware.
 
By using the latest version of MATLAB, you can benefit from the improved performance, functionality, and compatibility of the software. You can also access the extensive documentation, tutorials, examples, and community support that MathWorks provides. You can learn more about MATLAB and Simulink on the official website of MathWorks[^1^].
