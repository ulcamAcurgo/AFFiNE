The film is set in a fictional European country in the early 20th century, where magic and technology coexist. Sophie, a shy and timid hat-maker, meets Howl, a charismatic and mysterious wizard who can transform into a bird-like creature. Howl rescues Sophie from some soldiers who harass her, but this attracts the attention of the Witch of the Waste, who is jealous of Howl's beauty and power. The Witch curses Sophie to turn into an old woman and prevents her from telling anyone about her condition.
 
Sophie leaves her home and wanders into the countryside, where she encounters Howl's moving castle, a huge metal structure that can change its location and appearance. She enters the castle and meets Howl's companions: Markl, a young apprentice; Calcifer, a fire demon who powers the castle; and Heen, a dog-like spy. Sophie pretends to be Howl's new cleaning lady and gradually forms a bond with him and his friends.
