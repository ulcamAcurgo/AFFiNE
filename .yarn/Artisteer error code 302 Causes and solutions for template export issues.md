There are several possible causes and solutions for this error. Here are some of them:
 
- **Check your firewall settings.** Some firewalls may block Artisteer from accessing the internet and communicating with its server. You can try to disable your firewall temporarily or add Artisteer to the list of allowed programs in your firewall settings. For example, if you are using AVG security firewall, you can go to AVG settings and allow Artisteer to connect to the internet[^2^].
- **Check your internet proxy settings.** If you are using a proxy server to access the internet, you may need to configure Artisteer to use the same proxy settings. You can do this by going to File > Options > Proxy Settings in Artisteer and entering your proxy details.
- **Try to open http://54.218.66.112/ in your browser.** This is the address of Artisteer's server that handles the export function. If you can open this page and see "Cannot GET /" message, it means that the server is working and the problem is on your end. If you cannot open this page or see a different message, it means that the server is down or unreachable and you need to wait until it is fixed[^2^].
- **Remove any custom code from your template.** Some users have reported that adding custom PHP code to their templates caused the error code 302. If you have added any custom code to your template, try to remove it and see if the error persists. You can also try to export your template without any content or with minimal content and see if it works[^2^].
- **Update Artisteer to the latest version.** Artisteer may release updates that fix bugs and improve performance. You can check for updates by going to Help > Check for Updates in Artisteer or by visiting their website: http://www.artisteer.com/?p=news. The latest version of Artisteer as of April 2023 is 4.3[^3^].

If none of these solutions work for you, you can contact Artisteer support team and provide them with more details about your problem. You can also send them a wireshark trace of the communication between Artisteer and its server, which may help them identify and fix the issue[^3^].
