To access GM commands, you need to have a GM account or permission from the server owner. You also need to enable debug mode by typing `.a+b` in the chat box. This will open a small window on the top left corner of your screen that shows your coordinates and other information. To enter a GM command, you need to type a period (.) followed by the command name and any parameters. For example, `.mon 20 2 1 1` will spawn two aggressive Aibatts near you.
