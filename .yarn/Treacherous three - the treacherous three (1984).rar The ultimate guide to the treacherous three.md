They used complex rhymes, witty wordplay, and fast delivery that challenged the listeners to keep up with them. They also experimented with different genres and sounds, such as rock, funk, disco, and electro. They were not afraid to express their opinions and social commentary on topics such as politics, education, sex, and drugs.
 
The group also had a significant influence on the development of hip hop culture and history. They were among the first rap groups to perform live on stage with a DJ and a band. They also participated in many rap battles and competitions, such as the legendary showdown with Busy Bee Starski at Harlem World in 1981, where Kool Moe Dee famously dissed his opponent with his superior skills and knowledge. Kool Moe Dee later became one of the first rap artists to earn a Grammy Award for his solo work.

They briefly reunited in 1993 for a second album called Old School Flava, which featured guest appearances from Big Daddy Kane, Chuck D, Grandmaster Caz, Heavy D, and Melle Mel. The group also performed at the Rock Steady Crew's 20th anniversary concert in 2001. The Treacherous Three are widely regarded as one of the most influential and innovative rap groups of all time.
