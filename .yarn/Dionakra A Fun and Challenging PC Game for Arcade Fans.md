If you are a fan of arcade games, you might remember Breakout, the 1976 game where you control a paddle at the bottom of the screen and bounce a ball to destroy bricks at the top. Breakout was a simple but addictive game that inspired many clones and variations over the years. One of them is Dionakra, a PC game released in 1998 by BWM Software and published by Midas Interactive Entertainment and Prism Leisure.
 
Dionakra is similar to Breakout, but with some enhancements and a sci-fi theme. You play as Tony, a galactic dustbin man who has to clean up space crystals by breaking them with his ball and paddle. The game has 50 levels, each with different layouts, colors, and backgrounds. Some levels have obstacles or enemies that can block or damage your ball. The game also features many power-ups that can either help or hinder you. For example, some power-ups can make your paddle bigger or smaller, give you extra balls or lives, slow down or speed up the ball, add a laser gun or make the ball explosive.
