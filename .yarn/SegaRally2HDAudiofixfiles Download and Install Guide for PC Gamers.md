Sega Rally 2 is a fast-paced and fun racing game that offers four different game modes: Arcade, Championship, Time Attack, and Practice. You can choose from 21 different cars, each with their own handling and performance characteristics. You can also customize your car's settings, such as tires, suspension, and transmission.
 
The game features 17 tracks set in various locations around the world, such as desert, forest, snow, and city. The tracks have dynamic weather effects, such as rain, fog, and night. The tracks also have different surfaces, such as asphalt, gravel, mud, and ice. The surface affects the grip and handling of your car, so you have to adapt your driving style accordingly.

## Sega Rally 2 Reviews and Reception
 
Sega Rally 2 received positive reviews from critics and fans alike. The game was praised for its gameplay, graphics, sound, and replay value. The game was also compared favorably to other racing games of its time, such as Gran Turismo and Colin McRae Rally.
 
The game sold well in both Japan and Europe, where it was released as Sega Rally Championship 2. The game was also released in North America as Sega Rally 2: Sega Rally Championship.
