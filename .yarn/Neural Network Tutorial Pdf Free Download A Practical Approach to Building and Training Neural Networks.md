# Neural Networks: A Simple Introduction
 
Neural networks are a type of artificial intelligence that mimics the structure and function of the human brain. They consist of interconnected units called neurons that process information and learn from data. Neural networks can perform complex tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and machine translation.

## Neural Network Architecture
 
A neural network architecture defines how the neurons are organized and connected in the network. There are different types of neural network architectures, depending on the problem domain and the desired output. Some of the common architectures are:
 
- Feedforward neural network: This is the simplest type of neural network, where the information flows from the input layer to the output layer without any loops or cycles. The hidden layers can have different activation functions, such as sigmoid, tanh, or ReLU.
- Recurrent neural network (RNN): This is a type of neural network that has feedback connections, meaning that the output of a neuron can be fed back to itself or to previous neurons. This allows the network to have a memory of previous inputs and outputs, which is useful for sequential data such as text or speech.
- Convolutional neural network (CNN): This is a type of neural network that uses convolutional layers, which are composed of filters that slide over the input and perform element-wise multiplication and summation. This reduces the number of parameters and captures spatial features such as edges and shapes. CNNs are widely used for image processing and computer vision tasks.

In this tutorial, you will focus on feedforward neural networks, as they are the simplest and most intuitive to understand. However, you can also explore other architectures using Python libraries such as PyTorch or TensorFlow.

## Implementing a Feedforward Neural Network in Python
 
One of the most popular libraries for implementing neural networks in Python is PyTorch, which provides a high-level API for building and training deep learning models. In this section, you will learn how to use PyTorch to create a simple feedforward neural network that can classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
 
The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. Each image is 28 by 28 pixels and has a grayscale value between 0 and 255. The goal is to train a neural network that can take an image as input and output the correct digit label.
 
To implement a feedforward neural network in PyTorch, you need to follow these steps:
