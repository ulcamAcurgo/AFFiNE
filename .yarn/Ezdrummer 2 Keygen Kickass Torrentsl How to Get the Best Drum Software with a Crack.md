This feature allows you to tap your rhythm on your keyboard or MIDI controller, and EZdrummer 2 will analyze it and show you a list of similar grooves from the library. You can then select the one that suits your song best.

You can then edit or rearrange the sections as you like, and export them as a MIDI file or a song track.
