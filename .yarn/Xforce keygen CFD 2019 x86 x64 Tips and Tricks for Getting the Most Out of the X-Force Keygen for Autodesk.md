In this part of the article, we will show you some examples of how you can use Autodesk CFD 2019 to simulate different scenarios and optimize your designs. These examples are based on the sample files that are included with the software. You can find them in the **C:\Program Files\Autodesk\CFD 2019\Examples** folder.
 
## Example 1: Heat Sink
 
This example demonstrates how you can use Autodesk CFD 2019 to analyze the thermal performance of a heat sink. A heat sink is a device that transfers heat from a hot component to a cooler medium, such as air or water. The design of a heat sink affects its efficiency and reliability.
 
In this example, you will set up and run a steady-state thermal simulation of a heat sink with forced convection. You will use the **Heat Sink.fbm** file as the input geometry. You will apply boundary conditions, material properties, and solver settings. You will then run the simulation and view the results.
 
To follow this example, do the following steps:

1. Open Autodesk CFD 2019 and click on **New Simulation**.
2. Browse to the **C:\Program Files\Autodesk\CFD 2019\Examples** folder and select the **Heat Sink.fbm** file. Click on **Open**.
3. The geometry of the heat sink will appear in the simulation environment. You can use the navigation tools to zoom, pan, and rotate the view.
4. In the **Model Browser**, expand the **Boundary Conditions** node. You will see that some boundary conditions have been predefined for this example. You can double-click on each boundary condition to edit its properties.
5. The boundary conditions are as follows:
    - **Heat Source**: This is a surface boundary condition that represents the hot component that is attached to the heat sink. It has a fixed temperature of 100Â°C.
    - **Air Inlet**: This is a surface boundary condition that represents the inlet of the air flow that cools the heat sink. It has a fixed velocity of 1 m/s and a fixed temperature of 20Â°C.
    - **Air Outlet**: This is a surface boundary condition that represents the outlet of the air flow that cools the heat sink. It has a fixed pressure of 0 Pa and a fixed temperature of 20Â°C.
    - **Symmetry**: This is a surface boundary condition that represents the symmetry plane of the heat sink. It has no heat or mass transfer across it.
    - **Wall**: This is a surface boundary condition that represents the walls of the heat sink. It has no slip and no heat flux conditions.
6. In the **Model Browser**, expand the **Materials** node. You will see that two materials have been predefined for this example: Aluminum and Air. You can double-click on each material to edit its properties.
7. The material properties are as follows:
    - **Aluminum**: This is a solid material that has a density of 2700 kg/m3, a specific heat capacity of 900 J/kg-K, and a thermal conductivity of 237 W/m-K.
    - **Air**: This is a fluid material that has a density of 1.225 kg/m3, a specific heat capacity of 1006 J/kg-K, and a thermal conductivity of 0.0242 W/m-K.
8. In the **Model Browser**, expand the **Solver Settings** node. You will see that some solver settings have been predefined for this example. You can double-click on each solver setting to edit its properties.
9. The solver settings are as follows:
    - **Solver Type**: This is set to Steady State, which means that the simulation will run until a steady-state solution is reached.
    - **Solver Mode**: This is set to Pressure Based, which means that the pressure field will be solved first, followed by the velocity and temperature fields.
    - **Turbulence Model**: This is set to k-epsilon, which is a 8cf37b1e13
