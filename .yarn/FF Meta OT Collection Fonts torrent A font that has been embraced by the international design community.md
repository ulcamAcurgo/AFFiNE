But what if you don't have the budget to buy FF Meta OT Collection? Is there a way to download it for free? The answer is yes, but it comes with some risks and drawbacks. Some websites offer FF Meta OT Collection fonts as torrents, which are files that contain data that can be downloaded from peer-to-peer networks. Torrents are often used to share copyrighted content illegally, such as movies, music, games, and software.
 
Downloading FF Meta OT Collection fonts as torrents may seem tempting, but it is not recommended for several reasons. First of all, it is illegal and unethical. You are violating the intellectual property rights of the font designer and the font foundry, and you may face legal consequences if you get caught. Secondly, it is unsafe and unreliable. You may download viruses or malware along with the fonts, which can harm your computer or compromise your personal information. You may also get incomplete or corrupted files that do not work properly or look different from the original fonts.
 
Therefore, if you want to use FF Meta OT Collection fonts for your projects, the best option is to buy a license from FontFont or one of its authorized resellers. You will get the full and authentic version of the fonts, with all the features and support you need. You will also support the font designer and the font foundry, who deserve to be compensated for their work and creativity.
 
If you cannot afford to buy FF Meta OT Collection fonts right now, you can still use some alternatives that are free or cheaper. For example, you can try Fira Sans, a free font designed by Erik Spiekermann himself as a successor to FF Meta. Fira Sans has 32 styles and supports many languages and scripts. You can download it from Google Fonts or GitHub. Another option is Roboto, a free font designed by Christian Robertson for Google's Android platform. Roboto has 18 styles and is also available on Google Fonts.
 
FF Meta OT Collection is a beautiful and functional typeface that can enhance your designs. However, downloading it as a torrent is not worth the risk or the guilt. Instead, you should buy a license from FontFont or one of its authorized resellers, or use some free or cheaper alternatives that are similar to FF Meta.
