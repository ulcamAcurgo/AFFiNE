## What is Biotechnology?
 
Biotechnology is the science and technology of using living organisms or their products to modify or improve human health, agriculture, environment, and industry. Biotechnology has a long history of human use, dating back to ancient times when people used fermentation, selective breeding, and hybridization to produce food, beverages, medicines, and crops.
 
However, modern biotechnology emerged in the 20th century with the discovery of DNA, genes, and enzymes. These discoveries enabled scientists to manipulate the genetic material of living cells and create new organisms with desired traits. Some of the applications of modern biotechnology include:

- Medical biotechnology: This involves the use of biotechnology to diagnose, treat, prevent, and cure diseases. For example, biotechnology can produce vaccines, antibiotics, hormones, blood products, gene therapy, and stem cell therapy.
- Pharmaceutical biotechnology: This involves the use of biotechnology to develop and manufacture drugs and other therapeutic products. For example, biotechnology can produce recombinant proteins, monoclonal antibodies, biosimilars, and biopharmaceuticals.
- Agricultural biotechnology: This involves the use of biotechnology to improve the quality and quantity of crops and animals. For example, biotechnology can produce genetically modified organisms (GMOs), transgenic plants and animals, biopesticides, biofertilizers, and biofuels.
- Industrial biotechnology: This involves the use of biotechnology to produce chemicals, materials, and energy from renewable sources. For example, biotechnology can produce bioplastics, biofuels, biocatalysts, and biosensors.
- Environmental biotechnology: This involves the use of biotechnology to monitor, remediate, and conserve the environment. For example, biotechnology can produce biosensors, bioremediation agents, biofilters, and biofuels.
