## What is Tafsir al Muyassar and Why is it Useful?
 
Tafsir al Muyassar is one of the most popular and widely used tafsirs (exegeses) of the Quran in the Arabic-speaking world. It was first published in 2007 and has since been translated into several languages, including English, Urdu, Indonesian, and Turkish.
 
Tafsir al Muyassar is useful for anyone who wants to understand the Quran better and apply its teachings to their daily lives. It is especially suitable for beginners, students, and non-Arabic speakers, as it uses simple and clear language and avoids technical terms and complex discussions. It also provides practical examples and applications of the Quranic verses, as well as highlighting the moral and spiritual lessons that can be derived from them.
 
Tafsir al Muyassar is based on the principles of tafsir bil ma'thur (exegesis based on transmitted sources), which means that it relies on the authentic narrations from the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and his companions, as well as the opinions of the early generations of Muslim scholars. It also follows the methodology of tafsir bil mawdu' (thematic exegesis), which means that it organizes the Quranic verses according to their topics and themes, rather than their chronological order of revelation.
 
Tafsir al Muyassar is divided into 30 parts (juz'), each corresponding to one part of the Quran. Each part contains an introduction that summarizes the main topics and objectives of the verses in that part, as well as a conclusion that highlights the main lessons and benefits that can be derived from them. Each verse is then explained in detail, with relevant references to other verses, hadiths (sayings of the Prophet), and scholarly opinions.
