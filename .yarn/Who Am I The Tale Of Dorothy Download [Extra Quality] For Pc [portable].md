What is dissociative identity disorder (DID)? Dissociative identity disorder (DID) is a mental health condition that involves experiencing a disconnection and lack of continuity between thoughts, memories, surroundings, actions and identity. People with DID have two or more separate identities that control their behavior at different times. These identities are also known as alters, parts, or personalities. [1] [2]
 
DID is usually caused by severe and repeated trauma during childhood, such as physical, sexual, or emotional abuse, neglect, or violence. The child develops different identities as a way of coping with the overwhelming pain and fear. The identities may help the child escape, protect themselves, or express emotions that are not allowed by their abusers. [1] [2] [3]
 
People with DID may not be aware of their other identities or may have difficulty remembering what they do or say when they switch to another identity. They may also experience memory gaps for certain time periods, events, people, or personal information. They may feel detached from themselves and their surroundings, or have a distorted sense of reality. They may hear voices or see images of their other identities in their mind. [1] [2] [3]
 
DID can affect various aspects of a person's life, such as their relationships, work, education, health, and safety. People with DID often have other mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), substance use disorders, eating disorders, self-harm, and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. They may also have physical symptoms, such as headaches, chronic pain, seizures, or sleep problems. [1] [2] [3]
