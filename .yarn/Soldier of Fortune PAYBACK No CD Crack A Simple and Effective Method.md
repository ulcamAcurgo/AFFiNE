1. Download a No CD Crack file from a reliable source. A No CD Crack file is a modified version of the game's executable file that allows it to run without checking for the CD. You can find such files on various websites that offer game patches and fixes, such as [GameCopyWorld](https://www.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_soldier_of_fortune_payback.shtml). Make sure you download the file that matches your game version and language.
2. Backup your original game executable file. This is the file that you use to launch the game, usually named `SOF3.exe`. You can find it in the folder where you installed the game, typically `C:\Program Files (x86)\Activision Value\Soldier of Fortune Payback`. Copy this file to another location, such as your desktop, in case you need to restore it later.
3. Replace your original game executable file with the No CD Crack file. Copy and paste the No CD Crack file that you downloaded into the same folder where your original game executable file is located. You may need to confirm that you want to overwrite the existing file.
4. Run the game as usual. You should be able to play Soldier of Fortune: Payback without inserting the CD in the drive. Enjoy!

If you want to enjoy Soldier of Fortune: Payback to the fullest, you may want to check out some gameplay tips and tricks that can help you survive and succeed in the game. Here are some of them:

- Use cover often, even on easier difficulties. Running into an area full of enemies will get you killed quickly. This is especially true during boss fights, where staying back and behind cover is the best strategy[^2^] [^3^].
- Any weapon can kill from a distance. Shotguns have the least range, but even pistols can be used for long-range headshots. Crouching makes you more accurate[^2^] [^3^].
- Aim to dismember- you'll gain progress toward achievements and you'll put your foes out of commission faster[^2^] [^3^].
- When setting up Player Matches, use the Village and Abandon maps, as they are small but open, making them easy to learn and easy to find enemies in[^2^] [^3^].

Soldier of Fortune: Payback is a game that appeals to fans of gore and action. If you are looking for a challenging and brutal shooter, you may want to give it a try. However, be aware that the game also has many flaws and drawbacks, such as poor AI, bad story, and technical issues. You may want to read some reviews before buying it, or look for other games that offer a similar experience.
