## What is an Elf Team?
 
An Elf team is a team that consists mainly of units from the Elf tribe, which is one of the six tribes in Endless Frontier. Each tribe has its own strengths and weaknesses, as well as special abilities and skills. The Elf tribe has the following characteristics:
 
- Immune to blow attacks, which can push back or stun units.
- Has a high chance to skip stages when clearing them, which can save time and increase medal rewards.
- Has a high chance to activate 5x speed boost when clearing stages, which can also save time and increase medal rewards.
- Has units that can knock back enemies, preventing them from attacking or using skills.
- Has units that can buff movement speed, attack speed, attack range, and critical damage of allies.

## How to Choose Your Core Units
 
Your core units are the ones that will deal most of the damage and clear most of the stages for your team. They are also the ones that you should invest most of your medals on, as they will determine how far you can progress in the game. You should have two core units, one physical and one magical, to deal with different types of enemies. Here are some of the best core units for an Elf team:

- **Windwalker**: A magical unit that can fly over obstacles and enemies, has a fast attack speed and range, and can buff the movement speed and attack range of allies. It also has a skill that can deal massive damage to a single target and knock it back.
- **Elementalist**: A physical unit that can also fly over obstacles and enemies, has a high critical damage and rate, and can buff the attack speed and critical damage of allies. It also has a skill that can deal area damage and knock back enemies.
- **Hippogriff**: A physical unit that can fly over obstacles and enemies, has a high movement speed and attack range, and can buff the stage skipping chance of allies. It also has a skill that can deal area damage and knock back enemies.
- **Elf Sage**: A magical unit that can fly over obstacles and enemies, has a high attack speed and range, and can buff the movement speed and attack range of allies. It also has a skill that can deal area damage and knock back enemies.

## How to Choose Your Support Units
 
Your support units are the ones that will provide utility and buffs for your core units and your team. They are also the ones that you should invest less medals on, as they will not affect your progress as much as your core units. You should have 10 support units, preferably from the same tribe as your core units, to maximize their synergy. Here are some of the best support units for an Elf team:

- **Priest**: A unit that can activate 5x speed boost when clearing stages, which can save time and increase medal rewards. It also has a skill that can heal allies and increase their attack power.
- **Fairy**: A unit that can buff the stage skipping chance of allies, which can save time and increase medal rewards. It also has a skill that can deal area damage and knock back enemies.
- **Astral Captain**: A unit that can buff the movement speed, attack speed, attack range, and critical damage of allies. It also has a skill that can deal area damage and knock back enemies.
- **Alchemist**: A unit that can buff the movement speed, attack speed, attack range, and critical damage of allies. It also has a skill that can deal area damage and stun enemies.
- **Sylphid**: A unit that can buff the movement speed, attack speed, attack range, and critical damage of allies. It also has a skill that can deal area damage and knock
