Reinforced concrete is a composite material that consists of concrete and steel reinforcement. Concrete is strong in compression but weak in tension, while steel is strong in both compression and tension. By combining the two materials, reinforced concrete can resist various types of loads and stresses.
 
The design of reinforced concrete structures involves determining the dimensions, shape, and reinforcement details of the structural elements, such as beams, columns, slabs, and foundations. The design should ensure that the structure is safe, serviceable, economical, and durable. The design should also follow the relevant codes and standards that specify the material properties, loading conditions, safety factors, and design methods.
 
Advanced Reinforced Concrete Design by S.S. Bhavikatti covers the design of complex and special reinforced concrete structures that require more advanced analysis and design techniques. The book is divided into two volumes. The first volume deals with the design of basic reinforced concrete elements, such as singly reinforced beams, doubly reinforced beams, T-beams, one-way slabs, two-way slabs, short columns, and isolated footings. The second volume deals with the design of advanced reinforced concrete elements, such as building frames, continuous beams, flat slabs, shear walls, deep beams, long columns, combined footings, retaining walls, and water tanks.
